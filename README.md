# CLASS-Course-
In this project, you will learn how to plot the CMB power spectrum. Planck data can be downloaded from the Planck Legacy Archive under Cosmology → CMB Angular Power Spectrum.
To obtain the theoretical TT, TE, and EE spectra for a given cosmological model, you use CLASS.

## The PDF includes a conceptual discussion of the acoustic peaks in the CMB and a detailed interpretation of the corresponding power spectrum.
